### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the notebook and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

### If unable to download

A second version of this course has been optimized to run within your browser using Google's [Colab Environment](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).  That version of this course can be found at: https://github.com/mkitti/pandas-workshop


## Exercises

Github user guipsamora has created a repository of pandas exercises for various skill levels, starting from the very basics:

[Pandas Exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises)

Start with the [first set of exercises](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pandas_exercises/tree/master/01_Getting_%26_Knowing_Your_Data/Chipotle) and once you have completed those, pick a set that interests you.  

These exercises were forked from https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises.  If you see issues with the solutions or think something is wrong or could be improved, please [let us know](mailto:m-rich@northwestern.edu) so we can improve them for the next workshop.  We've revised the Chipotle exercises, but there are lots of exercises there that we haven't reviewed yet in detail.
